This is a work in progress basically none of the links work, its just an outline...
Started May 2024 - Present.

These resources were recommended to me to start learning about [graphene](https://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~phys123B/w2015/pdf_CoursGraphene2008.pdf),
[quantum hall effect](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.1998), and [quantum transport](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0412664). Eventually I hope to understand 
this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.1889) about non-abelian annyons and this paper by [Kitaev](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9707021).
