This is a work in progress basically none of the links work, its just an outline...
Started May 2024 - Present.

These resources were recommended to me to start learning about [graphene](https://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~phys123B/w2015/pdf_CoursGraphene2008.pdf), the [quantum hall effect](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.1998), and [quantum transport](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0412664). [Here](./resources.md) is a more compresensive list of resources I am collecting. 

#### Graphene

Over the course of my masters, I've made some graphene-based devices. I explain [here](./graphene_devices.md) how this is done.

  <img src="figures/devices/c02_100x.jpg" alt="Device 1" style="flex: 1 1 0; max-width: 50%; border:1px solid #ccc; height: auto;">
  <img src="figures/devices/c04_50x.jpg" alt="Device 2" style="flex: 1 1 0; max-width: 50%; border:1px solid #ccc; height: auto;">
</div>

#### Topology

I'd also like to learn about Topological Condensed Matter physics. Eventually I hope to understand this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0707.1889) about non-abelian annyons and this paper by [Kitaev](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9707021). 

I'm making an interactive game with plaquette and vertex operators so one can play around with the toric code, I will put it ( H E R E ) eventually :) 


#### Education
*   BSc Math and Physics University of Toronto
*   MSc Physics Chulalongkorn University (in progress)
