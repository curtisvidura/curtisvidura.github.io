  <h1> Braiding and Knots</h1>
  <em> May, 2024 </em>
  <p> A braid can be formed by exchanging points which overlap lines. Take for example a braid with i = 5 points. 
    We can represent an exchange with the operations sigma_1, sigma_2, sigma_3, Ïƒ_4. In general there are i-1 number of them.
    sigma_i exchanges the i point with the i+1 point. 
    A knot can be formed from taking the "closure" of a braid.
