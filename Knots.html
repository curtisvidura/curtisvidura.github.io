      <p style="font: size 26px" style="font-weight: lighter"> A braid can be formed by exchanging the endpoints of strings. Take for example a braid with i = 5 points. 
        We can represent an exchange with (i-1) number of operations, <strong> σ<sub>1</sub>, σ<sub>2</sub>, σ<sub>3</sub>, 
        σ<sub>4</sub> </strong>. <strong>σ<sub>i</sub></strong> exchanges the <em>i</em> point with the <em>i+1</em> point. The inverse of an exchange
        <strong>σ<sub>i</sub><sup>-1</sup></strong> is just exchanging it the opposite way.

      One might want to compare the Braid Group to the Permutation Group <Strong>S<sub>n</sub></Strong>, since the Braid Group
      also involves switching points around. Indeed there is a surjective homomorphism <strong>B<sub>n</sub>→S<sub>n</sub></strong>
      however, the Braid Group is infinite while <Strong>S<sub>n</sub></Strong> is not. 

      The Braid group will have some extra conditions, In the case of <strong>B<sub>4</sub></strong>

        A <strong>link</strong> is a collection of <strong>knot</strong> and they can be formed from taking the <i>closure</i> of a braid. This is done
        by connecting opposite ends of the strings by lines that do not intersect like such:

      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander%27s_theorem">Alexander's Theorem</a> states that every knot or link is the closure of some Braid. However, there can be many closed Braids 
        that coorespond to the same knot/link. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_theorem">Markov's Theorem</a> gives the conditions that tell whether or not two Braids lead to
        the same knot/link.

      <em> So what does this have to do with Physics? </em> 
      
      We are not so concerned with the exact paths of the particles, but we are concerned with keeping track whether or not some particle moves around the other. 
      One way to encode this information is through a braiding. 
      
      Aside: This only works in 2 spatial dimensions. If the particles lived in 1 dimensional space exchanging their positions would lead to them passing through each other at somepoint, 
      making it undefined. Furthermore, in 4 dimensional space if one wanted to tie a knot, there would always be that extra spatial degree of freedom availible to untangle it. 
      It is a fact of analysis that knots do not exist in more than 3 dimensions.
