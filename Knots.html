  <p> A braid can be formed by exchanging points which overlap lines. Take for example a braid with i = 5 points. 
    We can represent an exchange with the operations i-1 number of operations, σ_<sub>1</sub>, σ_<sub>2</sub>, σ_<sub>3</sub>, 
    σ_<sub>4</sub>. σ_<sub>i</sub> exchanges i point with the i+1 point. The inverse of an exchange is given by 
    σ_<sup>-1</sup>_<sub>1</sub>. If you wanted to exchange points 1 and 3, it would be equivalent to
